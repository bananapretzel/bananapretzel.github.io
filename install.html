      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <p><b>Is the launcher using Ashita only?</b></p>
      <p>Yes, the Eventide XI launcher is built on Ashita 4. Ashita is a popular third-party FFXI client that provides
        various enhancements and features for players.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Is it safe to use the launcher?</b></p>
      <p>Yes, using the Eventide XI launcher is safe. The server has implemented security measures to protect players'
        accounts and data. However, always ensure you download the launcher from the official Eventide XI website to
        avoid any potential security risks.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>How much space do I need for the launcher and the game?</b></p>
      <p>Allot approximately 185MB for the launcher, and 25GB for the game.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Can I use my existing FFXI installation with the launcher?</b></p>
      <p>No, the Eventide XI launcher uses it's own FFXI files. You cannot use your existing FFXI installation with the
        launcher.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Where can I get support if I encounter issues with the launcher?</b></p>
      <p>If you encounter any issues with the Eventide XI launcher, you can seek support through the official Eventide
        XI Discord server. The community and staff members are usually helpful in resolving any problems you may face.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Can I customize the launcher settings?</b></p>
      <p>Yes, the Eventide XI launcher allows you to customize various settings, including graphics options,
        keybindings, and addon configurations. You can access these settings through the launcher's interface.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Does the launcher store my password in plain text?</b></p>
      <p>No and yes. Your information is stored in a maximum of two places: the <code>ashita.ini</code>, and the
        launcher <code>user.json</code> files. By default, if you put in your username and password in the launcher and
        click <strong>PLAY</strong>, your <code>ashita.ini</code> file stores your information in the file in
        plain text. This is true for any server. The launcher stores your information in its own user.json storage file
        if you check the "Remember Credentials" box, however your password is encrypted in the <code>user.json</code>
        file. The best way around storing your password in plain text is to not input your username/password on the
        login page and manually enter it each time to play.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Is the launcher compatible with all operating systems?</b></p>
      <p>The Eventide XI launcher is primarily designed for Windows operating systems. While it may work on other
        platforms using compatibility layers or virtual machines, official support is focused on Windows.</p>
