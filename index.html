          <p>
            At Eventide XI, we understand that while Final Fantasy XI’s challenging gameplay is part of its charm,
            it can also be incredibly time-consuming and frustrating. The traditional model of camping monsters for days,
            only to compete with dozens of other players for a single claim, often results in burnout and disappointment.
            Time sinks like these can detract from the enjoyment of the game, especially for players balancing real-life
            responsibilities with their love for Vana’diel.
          </p>

          <p>
            To address these issues, we’ve reimagined many of the systems of the game with emphasis on reducing some of
            the more substantial end-game grinds and points of player friction. We’ve done that by:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Introducing deterministic loot systems</li>
            <li>Adding a system to force-pop HNMs</li>
            <li>Adding and altering EXP party mechanics</li>
            <li>Increasing the difficulty of many fights</li>
            <li>Adding entirely new systems and altering existing systems to increase player power</li>
            <li>Reducing travel constraints</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These changes are meant to reward effort while preserving the sense of accomplishment. Our goal is to foster a
            positive, collaborative environment where players can enjoy the challenges of endgame content without the grind
            overshadowing the experience. Read all about these <a href="pages/custom-changes.html">changes</a>.
