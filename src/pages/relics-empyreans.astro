                <h2>Empyrean Weapons</h2>
                <p>
                    Relics and their aftermath effects have been completley overhauled and redesigned to increase their power and usability. In era-accurate servers, it might take you over a year to obtain a relic but on <strong>Eventide</strong> we've drastically reduced the amount of time needed to invest so that players can finally enjoy seeing the fruits of their labour without getting burned out. Dynamis can only be run once a week but hundos can drop to individual participants at an average rate of 10-20 per run. Expect to get your relic weapon within three month of regular dynamis runs.
                </p>
