                    The ultimate chase piece for any dedicated adventurer. Only a handful of empyreans exist on the server as of December 2025 and most of the different weapon types have yet to be obtained. Mystery still surrounds the capabilties of these weapons but one thing is for certain, you will be in a very exclusive club should you manage to obtain one and you will be sought after by many.
