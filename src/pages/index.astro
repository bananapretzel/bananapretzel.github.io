            <strong>Eventide XI</strong> is designed for players who love classic
            Final Fantasy XI but don't want to commit to era-accurate grinding and
            years of camping while also avoiding a full easy-mode experience built
            around trusts and speed-running.
            <strong>Eventide XI</strong> strikes a middle ground, preserving the sense
            of accomplishment that old-school FFXI is known for: leveling together,
            camping NMs, and progressing with friends, while still embracing a power-fantasy
            where relic weapons are achievable in months, not years.
          </p>

          <p>
            To achieve this, we've reworked core systems to remove frustration,
            not difficulty:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Guaranteed loot systems</strong> — earn rewards through gameplay,
              not luck
            </li>
            <li><strong>Force-pop HNMs</strong> — no more claim drama</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improved EXP and party systems</strong> — for faster, smoother
              progression
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Harder fights</strong> — more mechanics, more teamwork, more
              fun
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dynamis drops</strong> — expect to get 10–20 hundos <strong
                >each</strong
              > per run
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Less travel time</strong> — spend more time playing, not running
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>And many more!</strong> — check the Custom Changes page for
              more info
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you love FFXI but want a version that fits your life without
            sacrificing challenge or community, Eventide XI is the experience
            you've been waiting for.
