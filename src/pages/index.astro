            <strong>Eventide XI</strong> keeps the challenge, depth, and excitement
            of FFXI, but removes the worst parts: toxic claim wars, endless camping,
            and days of grinding with nothing to show for it. We respect your time
            while preserving the feeling of achievement that makes FFXI unforgettable.
          </p>

          <p>
            To accomplish that, we’ve reworked core systems to remove
            frustration, not difficulty:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Guaranteed loot systems</strong> — earn rewards through gameplay,
              not luck
            </li>
            <li><strong>Force-pop HNMs</strong> — no more claim drama</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improved EXP and party systems</strong> for faster, smoother
              progression
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Harder fights</strong> — more mechanics, more teamwork, more
              fun
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>New mechanics and power options</strong> to expand player choice
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Less travel time</strong> — spend more time playing, not running
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>And many more!</strong> — check the Custom Changes page
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you love FFXI but want a version that fits your life—without
            sacrificing challenge or community—Eventide XI is the experience
            you’ve been waiting for.
