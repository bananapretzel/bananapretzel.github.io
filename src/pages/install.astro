      <h2>Installing Manually</h2>
      <p>
        If you prefer to install the game manually without using the launcher,
        follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download the 7.6 GB compressed client from this link:
          <a href="https://downloads.eventide-xi.com/EventideXI.zip" download
            >EventideXI.zip</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once downloaded, right-click the file → <strong>Extract Here</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the extracted <strong>Eventide</strong> folder to your main drive
          (typically <strong>C:\</strong>). After moving it, the full path
          should be: <code>C:\Eventide</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open the <strong>Eventide</strong> folder and run <strong
            >EventideConfigEditor.exe</strong
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Configure the following settings:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Set Window Width and Window Height to your monitor resolution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set Background Width and Background Height to roughly <strong
                >1.5x</strong
              > your Window Width/Height values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Menu Width and Menu Height are personal preference — you may match
              your Window values or make them smaller.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set Fullscreen Mode to <strong>Fullscreen Windowed</strong>, then
              save and close.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Run <strong>Launch_Eventide.bat</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the Ashita command-line interface appears, select option <strong
            >2</strong
          > — “Create a new account” — and follow the prompts.
        </li>
        <li>
          After creating your account (before logging in), close Ashita-CLI and
          reopen <strong>EventideConfigEditor.exe</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enter your new Eventide username and password, click <strong
            >Save</strong
          >, and close the window.
        </li>
        <li>
          Re-open <strong>Launch_Eventide.bat</strong>. Ashita will now
          automatically log you in every time you run it.

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <p><b>Is the launcher using Ashita only?</b></p>
      <p>
        Yes, the Eventide XI launcher is built on Ashita 4. Ashita is a popular
        third-party FFXI client that provides various enhancements and features
        for players.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Is it safe to use the launcher?</b></p>
      <p>
        Yes, using the Eventide XI launcher is safe. The server has implemented
        security measures to protect players' accounts and data. However, always
        ensure you download the launcher from the official Eventide XI website
        to avoid any potential security risks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>How much space do I need for the launcher and the game?</b></p>
      <p>Allow approximately 185 MB for the launcher, and 25 GB for the game.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Can I use my existing FFXI installation with the launcher?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, the Eventide XI launcher uses its own FFXI files. You cannot use
        your existing FFXI installation with the launcher.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Where can I get support if I encounter issues with the launcher?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you encounter any issues with the Eventide XI launcher, you can seek
        support through the official Eventide XI Discord server. The community
        and staff members are usually helpful in resolving any problems you may
        face.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Can I customize the launcher settings?</b></p>
      <p>
        Yes, the Eventide XI launcher allows you to customize various settings,
        including graphics options, keybindings, and addon configurations. You
        can access these settings through the launcher's interface.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Does the launcher store my password in plain text?</b></p>
      <p>
        Yes and no. Your information is stored in a maximum of two places: the <code
          >ashita.ini</code
        >, and the launcher's <code>user.json</code>
        file. By default, if you enter your username and password in the launcher
        and click <strong>PLAY</strong>, your <code>ashita.ini</code> file stores
        your information in plain text. This is true for any server.
        The launcher stores your information in its own user.json storage file if
        you check the "Remember Credentials" box; however, your password is encrypted
        in the <code>user.json</code> file. The best way around storing your password
        in plain text is to avoid entering your username/password on the login page and
        manually enter it each time you play.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Is the launcher compatible with all operating systems?</b></p>
      <p>
        The Eventide XI launcher is primarily designed for Windows operating
        systems. While it may work on other platforms, this hasn't been tested.
